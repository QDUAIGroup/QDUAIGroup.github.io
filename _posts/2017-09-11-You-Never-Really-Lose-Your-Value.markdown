A well known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill. In the room of 200, he asked, "What is this piece of paper and is it worth anything?""It is a $20 bill, encashable in international and national markets for its quoted value," replied one of the many participants who raised their hands.

The speaker proceeded to crumple the dollar bill up using both his hands till it became a bundle of wrinkled paper.

He then unfolded it again and making an unsuccessful attempt to keep it straight, he asked, "Would you still be able to negotiate it for its quoted value?""Yes!" was the echoing reply from the participants.

"Well," he said, "Looks like I haven't done enough! What if I do this?" And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, which was now all crumpled, dirty, defaced and not easy to recognize from a distance.

"Now will someone like to trade it for its quoted value?"Many hands went in the air.

"I think this piece of currency is still holding its quoted value," replied a participant in a slightly unsure voice.

"This bill can still fetch goods worth 20 dollars," said the other participant.

Everyone agreed.

"My friends, there is a very valuable lesson in this exercise that we are just through with. It may have appeared to some of you, that I was able to deshape, deface, mutilate and alter the $20 bill during the process as the effects were quite visible.

"However, no matter what I did to this piece of paper, you still upheld its negotiability because you were sure in your mind that my actions did not actually decrease its value. It was still a currency note worth $20.

"Many times in our lives, we feel like as if we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make or the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless. It may also appeal to onlookers as if it has really happened to certain extent. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, please remember you never lose your 'Value'."Values that you cherish are indeed devoid of worldly disturbance and always you're your saviour.


## 中文故事
 
 研讨会上，一位著名的演说者是这样开场的--他举起一张20美元的钞票，问在座的200名听众：“这张纸是什么？它有价值吗？”

  “这是一张20美元的钞票，按它的面值，在国际和国内市场都能兑换。”在众多举手的参与者中，一个人这样答道。

  于是，演说者把那张美钞揉成一团，搓成了一张皱巴巴的纸。

  接着，他又把美钞展开，并尽量把它弄平整，但仍然皱皱巴巴的。他问道：“按面值，你们还能把它兑换出去吗？”

  “能！”大家异口同声地说。

  “哦，”演说者说，“看来我做的还不够啊！要是我这么做呢？”他说着，就把那张20美元丢到地上，开始用鞋踩来踩去。然后，他捡起钞票，这时，那张钞票已经皱得不成样子了，而且脏兮兮的，面目全非，从远处很难认出是什么东西。

  “现在，还有人愿意按它的面值和我做交易吗？”

  许多人都举起了手。

  “我认为，这张钞票仍有票面价值。”一位听众回答道，声音中透着些许不自信。

  “这张钞票还可以买价值20美元的商品。”另一人说道。

  大家一致赞同。

  “朋友们，我刚刚所举的一个例子包含着一个深刻的道理，可能有些人已经意识到了。整个过程中，我把这张20美元的钞票弄得变形、走样，让它面目全非、残缺不全，结果你们也看到了。

  “但是，不论我怎么毁损这张美钞，你们仍对它的可流通性确信不疑，因为你们都认为，我对它所做的并没让它真正贬值。它还是一张价值20美元的钞票。

  “生活中，很多时候，我们总被自己作出的决定或遭遇的境况所困扰，觉得自己被扔在地上，揉成一团，被踩进烂泥里。我们觉得自己毫无用处；甚至在某种程度上，一个旁观者也可能这么认为。那么，朋友们，请记住，不论发生了什么，或将要发生什么，你都不会失去你的‘价值’。”

  你所珍视的价值一定不会受到尘世中各种纷扰的影响，它就是你一生的依靠。

  正如一张被折皱的钞票不会贬值一样，无论你在人生路上遭遇怎样的挫折，不管是被揉成团、压成饼，抑或被扔进臭水沟，都不要怀疑自己的价值，因为只要你还活着，健康地活着，你的生命就不会贬值，而你只需要用行动向世人证明这点。
